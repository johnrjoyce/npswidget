#summary Example code for using the NPS Widget

= Widget Usage =

The NPS Widget can be embedded in any web page by inserting the following lines in the page: 

{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
   nps_project_id = 3;
   nps_project_name = "My Project";
   nps_background_url = "http://<path_to_background>";
   nps_background_top_url = "http://<path_to_background_top>";
   nps_background_bottom_url = "http://<path_to_background_bottom>";
   nps_border = "y";
   nps_font_color = "336699";
</script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://<widgethost>/nps_widget/nps_widget-1.0.js"></script>
}}}


= Basic Parameters =

* nps_project_id - Project ID
* nps_project_name - Project name descriptor

At a minimum an end user should include both the "nps_project_id" and "nps_project_name" parameters. 

The project ID is the numeric ID value that is associated with the project name in the MySQL database project table. 

The project name descriptor is displayed within the text that appears above the NPS recommendation rating scale in the widget. The default text reads: "How likely is it that you would recommend this to a friend or colleague?" But with the project name descriptor parameter specified by the end user, using our example above the text would read: "How likely is it that you would recommend My Project to a friend or colleague?"
