This Javascript widget can be easily embedded into your pages to allow users to give you NPS ratings as well as some quick feedback about their experience.  Results are stored on your server via PHP and MySQL.

The main purpose is to ask just a single question ("How likely are you to recommend this to a friend or colleague?") as defined by the Net Promoter Score or NPS. More information on NPS can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter_Score).

After a score is selected, the widget asks the user if he/she is willing to give any additional feedback about their selection (it's optional).

## Features and Components ##
The [list of current features](Features.md) gives details about these components:
  * **Widget** - Javascript that displays the widget in your web pages
  * **Capture** - PHP scripts that run on your server to capture the ratings and submissions from the widget into a MySQL database
  * **Admin** - PHP that runs on your server to administer the system (e.g. create new widgets, display code configurator) and report NPS scores / results (e.g. graphs, statistics, browse comments, etc).

## Examples ##
There are plenty of [examples for how to embed the widget in your pages](Examples.md) available.
